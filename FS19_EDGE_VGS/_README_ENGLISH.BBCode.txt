[b][u]Mod description[/u][/b]

With this mod you can put your fleet of vehicles into 10 groups, and then be able to switch between vehicles that is in the same group.

In a multiplayer game, players can modify the VeGS list, if the server/hosting player has enabled "Reset Vehicles" in the Admin-screen, or for a dedicated server given trusted players "Admin" setting.

[b][u]How to use it[/u][/b]

[u]Setting up controls[/u]

Before loading a game, make sure you go into 'Options - Controls', and verify that the "VeGS: ..." keys are set to your suiting.

Do note that the 'VeGS: Switch within group' and 'VeGS: To next group' actions are not assigned, so make sure you [b]assign your own keys[/b] to it. - For starters I suggest you choose a key that is [u]not[/u] TAB and [u]not[/u] a letter or number.

[u]Placing vehicles into groups[/u]

When you first start your game, none of the vehicles are assigned to a group. So begin by entering a vehicle and then activate the 'VeGS: Toggle edit-mode' (default is [b]LEFT CTRL E[/b]).

An overlay will appear, containing 10 groups and an 'Unassigned' group. Now move the current vehicle to a group of your own choosing, by using the 'Menu Up' & 'Menu Down' keys (default is [b]ARROW UP[/b] and [b]ARROW DOWN[/b].) If there are more vehicles within a group, you can choose the exact position using 'Menu Left' & 'Menu Right' keys (default [b]ARROW LEFT[/b] & [b]ARROW RIGHT[/b].)

While still in 'edit-mode', it is possible to switch to the next vehicle using the normal known method, and you can then repeat the process of placing into groups.

Once you're done placing vehicles into groups, deactivate the 'VeGS: Toggle edit-mode'. - These group assignments you've just made, will be saved whenever you normally save your game. So they will automatically be restored when loading a savegame.

[u]Renaming the group-names (optional)[/u]

It is possible to rename the group-names, if so needed.

When in 'edit-mode', press-and-hold the modifier-key and digit 'Group #' key-sequence until the chat entry-field appears, which shows the current group-name.

Type in your new group-name. The group-names, that contain vehicles, will be saved with the Vehicles.XML in the savegame# folder.

[u]Switching groups/vehicles[/u]

Now that the initial labour intensitive part of placing vehicles into groups is done - do take a break if you're feeling dizzy from all your hard work - the fun part begins; to actually switch between vehicles more directly than normal.

To switch to the next [u]enabled[/u] group that has vehicles in it, press your self-assigned key for 'VeGS: To next group'.

To switch within a group that has more vehicles in it, use your self-assigned key for 'VeGS: Switch within group'.

To switch directly to or within a group, even a disabled group, you can also use one of the ten assigned key-sequences. Default is [b]LEFT CTRL + [i]'group #'[/i][/b].

[u]Enable/disable group[/u]:

When using the 'To next group' key, you have the possibility to disable groups - i.e. make it so 'To next group' skips a disabled group.

To disable or enable a group, press-and-hold the modifier-key and digit 'Group #' key-sequence for about a second. When a group is disabled, it will appear in gray colors.

Do note that these enabled/disabled groups will NOT be synchronized to the other players. Each player can have their own enabled/disabled groups, which will not be saved though.

[u]Default action/key assignments[/u]:

Note: All VeGS key-assignments (except for the 'Switch within group' and 'To next group') [i]MUST USE[/i] the same modifier-key - i.e. LEFT-CTRL, RIGHT-CTRL, LEFT-ALT, RIGHT-ALT, LEFT-SHIFT or RIGHT-SHIFT. - The reason for this, is to make the overlay appear before the actual group-selection is made; i.e. pressing the digit key.

Note: Since it is possible to crouch in FS17, then when on-foot you must double tap the modifier-key to show the VeGS overlay.

[i]not assigned[/i] - VeGS: Switch within group
[i]not assigned[/i] - VeGS: To next group
[b]LEFT-CTRL 1[/b] - VeGS: Group 1
[b]LEFT-CTRL 2[/b] - VeGS: Group 2
[b]LEFT-CTRL 3[/b] - VeGS: Group 3
[b]LEFT-CTRL 4[/b] - VeGS: Group 4
[b]LEFT-CTRL 5[/b] - VeGS: Group 5
[b]LEFT-CTRL 6[/b] - VeGS: Group 6
[b]LEFT-CTRL 7[/b] - VeGS: Group 7
[b]LEFT-CTRL 8[/b] - VeGS: Group 8
[b]LEFT-CTRL 9[/b] - VeGS: Group 9
[b]LEFT-CTRL 0[/b] - VeGS: Group 10
[b]LEFT-CTRL E[/b] - VeGS: Toggle edit-mode

[b][u]Problems or bugs?[/u][/b]

If you encounter problems or bugs using this mod, please use the support-thread.

Known bugs/problems:
- In multiplayer, when two or more players are editing the VeGS list at the same time, it is undetermined what the results will be.
- Other mods' key-sequences may conflict with the same that VeGS are using, in particular the modifier-key. Use your best judgement to re-assign the key actions in the 'Options - Controls' screen, to suit your game-style.
- Translations are not good enough, as some have been machine-translated.
